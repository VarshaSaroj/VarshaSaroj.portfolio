              <h2>Project 1</h2>
              <p><b>Its a team work </b>,We have created this game using Python v3.7
                and its different modules , such as Pygame,
                Tkinter, os, sys,csv ,mixer,button, random etc.
                We have used Pycharm editor since it
                provides an IDE, i.e. integrated development
                environment and makes coding easier. We
                have also used SQLite for our database. We
                have made separate python files for the main
                project, for login/registration page and for
                instructions to increase modularity. All
                images are non- copyrighted, and are from
                Google. These images have been edited on
                Canva and their background was removed
